# Derivation schema examples

These fixtures exercise `yaml/schema.yaml` with small inputs and exact expected
outputs. They are intended for human review, automated tests, and AI-assisted
implementation.

Execution behavior is defined by the normative rules in
[`../rules/README.md`](../rules/README.md). Example READMEs describe only the
fixture-specific application of those rules.

`odm.csv` is a tabular projection of ODM clinical data, not an ODM exchange
document itself. Its fields map to the official
[CDISC ODM 2.0 clinical-data schema](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-ODM/blob/main/schema/ODM-clinicaldata.xsd).

Dataset declarations, variable references, and ODM contextual lookups are
governed by [R002](../rules/R002-source-binding.md).

Examples are ordered by increasing complexity:

1. `sdtm-dm-basic` — direct mapping, literals, terminology mapping, and a
   current-dataset reference.
2. `sdtm-lb-findings` — row construction, wide-to-long Findings conversion,
   missing-result filtering, and sequence generation.
3. `sdtm-relrec-related-records` — row construction from multiple source
   datasets for a one-to-many relationship between records.
4. `adam-adlb-bds` — source-dataset enrichment, baseline selection, change from
   baseline, percentage change, and analysis sequence.

Each example contains a specification, source CSV files, an expected CSV, and
a README defining behavior that an implementation must reproduce.
