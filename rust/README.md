# yamaa Rust workspace

The shared engine prepares specifications, builds domains and renders submission
documents for the Python and R packages. Language contracts live in
[rules/](../rules/README.md), syntax and schemas in [yaml/](../yaml/README.md),
and executable examples with authored expected results in
[benchmarks/](../benchmarks/README.md).

The [contributor guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns crate boundaries, locked builds
and local verification commands. The
[release guide](../docs/release.md) owns supported platforms, approved decisions
and migration notes. Declared exports are read from the host sources
themselves; there is no committed API inventory. Current rule checks and
schema-owner controls are described in the [contributor guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md#develop-and-verify).
[Installed package checks](qualification/README.md) compare actual Python and R
results with authored expected data. The workflow recipes in
[.github/workflows/](../.github/workflows/) define the platform matrix and
packaging checks. Host usage and installation commands live in
[python/README.md](../python/README.md) and [R/yamaa/README.md](../R/yamaa/README.md).

Expected benchmark data and Parquet fixtures are authored truth. Preserve their
bytes when changing implementation or repository structure.

Layer composition and null handling follow the
[composition contract](../rules/specification/composition.md).

The adapter enables independent `yaml`, `parquet` and `readstat` Cargo features
by default. Python wheels, Python source installations and R source packages use
that default and retain every supported format. Rust embedders can select only
the physical formats they need:

```toml
yamaa-adapters = { path = "rust/crates/yamaa-adapters", default-features = false, features = ["yaml"] }
```

| Feature | Dependency edge and capability |
| --- | --- |
| `yaml` | Saphyr parser and adapter scalar decoding; admits specification, schema, environment, project-lock and style YAML bytes. |
| `parquet` | Parquet source and artifact encoding, schema metadata, and Brotli, Gzip, LZ4, Snappy and Zstd codecs. Zstd builds native C through `zstd-sys` and `cc`. |
| `readstat` | Bundled read-only C backend and direct `cc` build dependency for `.sas7bdat` and `.xpt` input. |
| No format features | CSV and Arrow table/IPC representation remain available, including supplied Arrow batches. No YAML parser, Parquet codec, ReadStat or native compression build is selected. |

Arrow arrays, buffers, schemas, IPC and FlatBuffers are representation and host
transfer dependencies shared by every configuration. They do not enable a
physical reader. The semantic `yamaa-core` crate remains independent of all
these codecs and representation libraries; callers can supply owned documents,
plans and tables to its ports without a physical reader.

Format APIs and their public error types remain available with features omitted.
YAML admission returns `yaml_decode::DecodeFailure::Unavailable`, Parquet input
returns `parquet_source::Error::ReaderUnavailable`, Parquet output returns
`parquet_artifact::Error::Unavailable`, and SAS input returns
`sas_source::Error::Unavailable`. These capability failures do not become
malformed-source language findings. Capture and ingest boundary replies expose
`yaml_reader_unavailable`, `parquet_reader_unavailable` and
`sas_reader_unavailable`; unavailable Parquet compression retains its separate
`parquet_codec_unavailable` code.

The optional-format CI matrix runs no-default, each individual feature and all
three features. Each lane exercises enabled-format fixtures and disabled
capabilities, verifies the Cargo graph, and inspects the linked test binary for
ReadStat and Zstd symbols. Run a lane locally from the repository root with
`python -m tools.ci.format_features none` (or `yaml`, `parquet`, `readstat`,
`all`). YAML-dependent specification and project fixture suites run whenever
`yaml` is selected; Arrow/CSV/IPC controls remain active without it. Ordinary
Python/R checks and native wheel/source qualification retain the packaged default.

Arrow/Parquet release-specific operations live in the adapter's
`storage_api` module: fallible IPC schema conversion, logical timestamp/integer
construction, and logical-type inspection. The canonical lock and manifests
continue to select 60; using 57 requires adapting this boundary and qualifying
that dependency graph. Keep malformed-schema rejection and the closed output
profile when adapting the boundary.
